The `main` branch contains a stable version of the website, intended for use in production. Other branches contain indev features, or features that are no longer being worked on.

`Dev` contains the most up to date significant changes, but does not promise to be stable. Caution is advised before trying to run from this branch.

```
node app.js

A message indicating the port the server is listening on should then appear in the console.

To end the server, simply input `CTRL C`.
